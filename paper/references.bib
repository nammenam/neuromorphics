% --- ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (Foundations)
% -------------------------------------------------------------------

% Summary: This is the foundational paper of Artificial Intelligence.
% Alan Turing proposes the "Imitation Game" (now the Turing Test)
% to answer the question, "Can machines think?" It sets the entire
% philosophical and practical agenda for the field.

}

% Summary: This paper presents the first mathematical model of a
% "neuron" (the McCulloch-Pitts neuron). The authors show how these
% simple binary units can be networked together to perform any logical
% function, laying the groundwork for all future neural networks.

% Summary: This paper introduces the "Perceptron," the first algorithm
% for a trainable neural network. It's a linear classifier that can
% learn from data, and it's the direct ancestor of modern,
% multi-layered networks.

}

% Summary: This is the paper that (re)popularized the backpropagation
% algorithm. It provided an efficient way to train deep, multi-layer
% neural networks, overcoming the limitations of the original
% Perceptron. This algorithm is the engine behind the entire
% modern deep learning revolution.

% Summary: This is the "AlexNet" paper. By using a deep convolutional
% neural network (CNN) trained with backpropagation on GPUs, the
% authors won the 2012 ImageNet competition by a massive margin.
% This single paper ignited the modern boom in deep learning.

% -------------------------------------------------------------------

% Summary: This is arguably the most important paper in neuroscience.
% Hodgkin and Huxley used the squid giant axon to develop a complete
% mathematical model of the action potential (the "spike").
% It describes how ion channels (Na+ and K+) create the nerve impulse.

% Summary: This is not a paper, but the foundational book that
% proposed the mechanism for synaptic plasticity now known as
% "Hebbian Learning." It contains the famous phrase:
% "Neurons that fire together, wire together." This is the
% biological basis for learning and memory that inspires many AI rules.

% Summary: This Nobel Prize-winning work is a cornerstone of
% sensory neuroscience. Hubel and Wiesel recorded from neurons in the
% cat's visual cortex and discovered its hierarchical structure,
% finding "simple" and "complex" cells that respond to specific
% orientations and edges. This work directly inspired the
% architecture of modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

% --- NEUROMORPHIC COMPUTING (Foundations)
% -------------------------------------------------------------------

% Summary: This paper, by Carver Mead, essentially founded the field
% of neuromorphic engineering. Mead argued for building electronic
% circuits that operate in the same way as biological neurons
% (using analog, sub-threshold physics) rather than just simulating
% them on digital computers.

}

% Summary: This is a classic early example of Carver Mead's vision
% in practice. Mahowald and Douglas built a "silicon neuron"—a
% physical VLSI chip that implemented the Hodgkin-Huxley model's
% dynamics, successfully mimicking the electrical behavior of a
% real biological neuron in hardware.

% Summary: This paper describes the SpiNNaker (Spiking Neural Network
% Architecture) project. It's a landmark in large-scale neuromorphic
% systems, using a million ARM processors in parallel to simulate
% spiking neural networks in real-time, focusing on computational
% neuroscience and robotics.
